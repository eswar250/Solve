              <strong>Potti Sreeramulu </strong>
              Sriramulu was born to Guravayya and Mahalakshmamma in 1901 at
              Padamatapalli in a district that once was itself a region within
              Nellore district. He was born in a Hindu family of Komati
              caste.[1] Later, their family was shifted to Madras as famine
              conditions prevailed in this region. They later lived in Nellore,
              Andhra Pradesh.[2][3][4][5] He completed his high school in Madras
              and joined the Victoria Jubilee Technical Institute in Bombay to
              study sanitary engineering.[6] After his college education,
              Sreeramulu joined the Great Indian Peninsular Railway, Bombay. In
              1929, Sreeramulu lost both his wife and his newborn child. Two
              years later, he resigned from his job and joined Gandhi's
              Sabarmati Ashram to serve the struggle for Indian Independence.[3]
